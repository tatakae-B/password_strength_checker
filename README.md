# 🔐 AI-Based Password Strength Checker

A simple **Python-based Password Strength Checker** that evaluates password security using **regex and entropy calculations**. If the password is weak, it provides **feedback** and suggests **stronger alternatives**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Checks password strength based on:
   - Length  
   - Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters  
   - Entropy (randomness)  

✅ Provides feedback for weak passwords.  
✅ Suggests **random strong passwords** if the entered password is weak.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3+**  
- **Regex (`re`)**  
- **Math (`math.log2` for entropy calculation)**  
- **Random (`random`, `string` for password suggestions)**

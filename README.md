A Python-based **Password Strength Checker** that evaluates password security using **regex and entropy calculations**. If a password is weak, it provides **feedback** and suggests **stronger alternatives**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Checks password strength based on:  
   - **Length**  
   - **Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters**  
   - **Entropy (randomness of characters)**  

✅ Provides **feedback** on weak passwords.  
✅ Suggests **secure random passwords** if the entered password is weak.
